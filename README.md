Application for a student analyst position at UCLA soccer(Bryan Mui)

Idea: Interactive dashboard(like stiddle compare date) that allows comparison of various metrics 

Variables that Coach is interested in:    
  + Box entries  
    - How many instances did the attack allow entering the box
    - *metric not really recorded*
  + Touches in the box
    - How many touches were allowed in the box
    - *metric not really recorded*, *paired with touches in the penalty area*
  + Positional attacks
    - How many possessions lead to a shot 
    - *metric recorded*
  + Turnover in own half  
    - Losing the ball in our team's own half
    - *need a separate idea for this* 
  + Crosses and area  
    - Which area were the crosses and how accurate were they 
    - *Crosses recorded, not area*
